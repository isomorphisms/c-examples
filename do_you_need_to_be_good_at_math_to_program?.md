#### Do you need to be good at mathematics to program?

No. Being good at one actually makes you worse (sometimes much worse) at the other.

Mathematics treats eternal themes. Most of what underlies programming is engineering standards worked out decades ago, but which to you might as well be opaque and arbitrary. (Often they were decided for good reason, but you hopefully wonâ€™t even need to learn what they are: someone else (whoever wrote your library/framework) handles that for you.



#### What about "humanities"?

There are a lot of them. There certainly is something to the idea that engineers are rigid, money-hungry, and unable to think like normal people. I believe this can be overcome. Reading (and thinking about) good books helps.
