Copied from MIT xv6 (on github and OCW).

The shell makes system calls. System calls cross over from a user's instructions to kernel land. Kernel land is where hardware usage is negotiated. See `what does an operating system do?` in `..`.

Shell *scripts* are written in a crappy programming language. They thus crappily organize the user's instructions.
